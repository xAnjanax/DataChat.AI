# DataChat.AI

## Project Summary 

This project aims to develop a recommendation-based chatbot that assists data analysts, by providing tailored suggestions and recommendations based on the dataset they are working with. The chatbot will empower analysts to make more informed decisions and streamline the process of data exploration, visualization, and interpretation, without replacing their core analytical tasks. It bridges the gap between fully automated tools and manual exploration. Rather than the approach of automated tools that take control, this chatbot empowers analysts by guiding them with expert advice as and when required, without replacing their hands-on work. 

Users can upload CSV files (datasets), communicate with the chatbot and ask questions ranging from "How many rows and columns are in the dataset?" to "Should I use a scatter plot or a line plot to show the relationship between variable 'X' and 'Y'?", and more. Users can then head over to the plot page, and with the help of the suggestions and guidance provided by the chatbot, they can bring their visualizations to life. 

This project provides an interface that uses conversational AI, offers context-sensitive, on-demand suggestions tailored to the dataset being analyzed. It supports decision-making by suggesting next steps, statistical methods, or visualizations while allowing the analyst to retain full control over the analysis process.
